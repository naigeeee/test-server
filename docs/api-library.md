# The API Library — building apps against existing APIs

The Substrait portal serves a catalogue of APIs an app can be built against. It has two kinds
of entries, and they are called in **two different ways** — getting them the wrong way round
is the mistake to avoid.

- **`internal`** — company APIs registered by platform admins. Each carries a name, slug,
  description, tags, a base URL, `auth_notes`, and a full OpenAPI spec. Apps call these
  **through the platform gateway**, never directly.
- **`app`** — deployed Substrait apps. Each has its endpoint inventory and its
  `https://<slug>.apps.substrait.build` URL. Apps call these **directly**.

## Browsing the library

```bash
bash substrait.sh library list [--q TERM] [--tag TAG]    # the whole catalogue (JSON)
bash substrait.sh library show internal|app SLUG         # one entry + endpoint summary
bash substrait.sh library spec [internal|app] SLUG [--out FILE]  # full OpenAPI doc
```

Needs the **account** personal access token (`sbt_…`) — an app-scoped deploy token cannot
browse the library. If you get a 401, run `bash substrait.sh link` first.

Prefer the endpoint summaries from `show`; pull a full spec to a file (`--out`) only when you
need request/response detail, and grep it rather than printing it.

**Data groups and visibility.** The catalogue is published through the org's data groups. An
operation (endpoint + method) is visible only to members who hold a group that names it. If
the catalogue comes back empty or an API is missing, suggest an org admin add the operations
to a data group the account holds — don't retry or treat it as an outage.

## Calling an internal API — through the gateway

Company APIs are never called with a credential the app holds. The app calls the platform's
**egress gateway**, and the gateway attaches the real credential on its behalf:

```
GET $SUBSTRAIT_EGRESS_URL/<entry-slug>/<the API's own path>
Authorization: Bearer $SUBSTRAIT_EGRESS_TOKEN
```

Both variables are injected by the platform. **Do not declare them in `.env.example`** — they
are reserved, and a declaration is *silently ignored* (the deploy succeeds but the variable
never appears, which is much harder to debug than an error).

**What this means for your design:**

- **Never design an env var for that API's key, token, or base URL.** There is nothing for
  the user to paste. If you find yourself writing `ORDERS_API_KEY=  # secret`, you have
  designed the pre-brokering shape by mistake.
- Build the URL from `$SUBSTRAIT_EGRESS_URL` + the entry slug + the path from the spec.
- `auth_notes` describes how the API authenticates — context for the design conversation, not
  instructions for the app to follow.

**Access must be granted before any call works.** The app needs an approved grant for that
entry, requested on the app's **Access** tab in the portal. Tell the user this is needed — an
app that builds fine and then 403s at the gateway looks like a bug when it is really a pending
approval. Raise it as part of shipping rather than leaving the user to discover it.

## Calling an app API — directly

Another Substrait app's API is **not** brokered. Call it directly at its
`https://<slug>.apps.substrait.build` base URL, which belongs in a custom env var in
`backend/.env.example` as it always did. Note it may sit behind that app's Google SSO proxy —
check with the app's owner whether a service path exists.

## Development access — seeing real responses while you build

A **person** (not an app) can be granted **development access** to call an internal API from
the editor through the platform:

```bash
bash substrait.sh library access                          # your access, every state
bash substrait.sh library request <slug> --reason "…"     # ask the data owner (≥10 chars)
bash substrait.sh library call <slug> GET /path           # make a real call
bash substrait.sh library call <slug> GET /path --out file.json  # save the response
```

What development access is:

- **Read-only.** `GET`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` only — writes are refused before they leave the
  platform.
- **Time-boxed.** The owner grants 30 or 60 days. When it lapses, `call` says so.
- **Scoped like the spec.** You can only call operations your account can *see*.
- **Production data.** Treat what comes back as you would production records — use it to learn
  shapes, never paste it into code, fixtures or commit messages.

Ask for it early — the owner is a person and may take a day — and keep designing from the spec
in the meantime. `show internal <slug>` carries `development_access` with your current state.

## Data that isn't in the library — ask for a data set

When what the user needs lives in the data warehouse or Redash but no catalogue entry covers
it, offer to ask for a data set. Describe it in the user's words — **never SQL**; a curator
writes and reviews the query:

```bash
bash substrait.sh library ask-data --title "What to call it" \
  --question "What the user wants to answer (10+ characters)" \
  --reason "What they're building, and for whom (10+ characters)" \
  [--source "a table, Redash query or report they know of"] [--filters "date range, hub, …"]
bash substrait.sh library data-requests      # where each of their requests stands
```

A curator publishes it or declines with a reason; the user is emailed either way. The data
may already exist but be hidden from them (visibility is per data group), in which case the
curator points them at it. Meanwhile, design against what exists — never invent the data.
Needs the account link, like every library command.

## Designing an app from the library

1. `list` the catalogue and shortlist entries relevant to what the user wants to build.
2. `show` the shortlisted entries; read `auth_notes` and the endpoint summaries.
3. Agree the design with the user: endpoints consumed, what the app stores vs fetches live,
   and the app's own API/frontend surface. Env vars only for `app` entries' base URLs —
   internal APIs need none.
4. Scaffold and implement, then link and deploy.
5. For each internal API consumed, make sure access is requested and approved — the app
   deploys without it and then gets refused at the gateway, so raise it as part of shipping.
